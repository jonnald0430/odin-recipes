        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe, usually around 375°F (190°C).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Prepare the sauce:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> In a large skillet or saucepan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant. If you're using ground meat, add it to the skillet and cook until browned. Then, add your tomato sauce or marinara sauce, along with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes to develop flavors.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Prepare the filling:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and any other desired ingredients such as chopped spinach or cooked vegetables. You can also add an egg to the mixture to help bind it together.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the noodles:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're using traditional lasagna noodles, cook them according to the package instructions until they're al dente. If you're using no-boil noodles, you can skip this step.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Assemble the lasagna:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start by spreading a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a baking dish to prevent the noodles from sticking. Then, layer lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers until you've used up all of your ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Bake the lasagna:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly. Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the top to brown.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Let it rest:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the lasagna is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice and serve.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Serve and enjoy:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slice the lasagna into portions and serve hot. It pairs well with a side salad and garlic bread for a complete meal.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
